BCB 570 Project Outline 

Dataset:
Data downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) website: 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geoprofiles/41147670 

Data contains the gene expression profiles in Leukocytes of patients with Sepsis. Ill patients 
have gram-positive or gram-negative sepsis. The data also contains the control (healthy samples). 

Prospective topics:
1. Differential gene expression in healthy, vs ill patients 
2. Differentiate the GO enrichment analysis between healthy, gram-negative sepsis, gram-positive 
   sepsis patients 
3. Dimension reduction and visualization from gene expression profiles 
4. Create a gene regulatory network using expression profile and human transcription factors (downloaded from
    AnimalTFDB3.0) 
   These are crucial for understanding the host response at the genetic level, including how the immune system 
   reacts to the infection, how various signaling pathways are activated or repressed, and how these changes 
   contribute to the pathology of sepsis.
